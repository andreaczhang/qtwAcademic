# Resubmission 2022.12.21

In this version I did the following:

- reduced the size of the installed package by changing the dataset included in the vignette

- updated the names of external package with single quotation mark (i.e. 'Quarto') in the package title and description

- in the example make_template(), changed path into tempdir()

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.
